# Code-Test
These are my files for the BraveUX Code Test.

Normally I'd have separated out the JS and CSS and not kept them in the index file however it felt it would be faster for me to complete the project doing it this way.

Yes, I'm aware, a lot of code spaghetti. This test was completed in about 4 hours (normally it'd be an 8 hour thing). Not an excuse, just a sermon.
